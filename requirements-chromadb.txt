# Optional: ChromaDB Dependencies
# Install this ONLY if you need semantic vector search for large-scale memory
#
# WARNING: This will download 1-2GB+ of dependencies including:
# - onnxruntime (may include CUDA support if NVIDIA GPU detected)
# - hnswlib (C++ vector search library)
# - Various ML model dependencies
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements-chromadb.txt
#
# Use cases:
# - Production with >10,000 memory entries
# - Need semantic similarity search (not just keyword matching)
# - Server has GPU for acceleration

chromadb==0.4.24

# Optional: Sentence transformers (if you want custom embeddings)
# Note: Not currently used in codebase, but useful for custom semantic search
# sentence-transformers==2.5.1
